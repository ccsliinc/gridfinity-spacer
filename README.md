# gridfinity-spacer
This is an OpenSCAD script to generate spacers for the top of divided bins to use with "Modern Gridfinity Case by Matthew"

Download and open spacer.scad with OpenSCAD and edit the 4 variables on top to generate a space which will allow bins with subdivisions to not mix over the top while placed inside the case.
